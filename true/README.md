### Sergey Trubitsyn

Sergey is my good friend. It will be correct to say, he was my good friend. He was tragically killed at 2006.   
He was a fascinating person: musician, and songwriter. Everything what
I can do now — just a leave little monument at the Network in memory of   
Rest in peace, Sergey
